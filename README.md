# Leetcode Torture

*Leetcode is love, Leetcode is life*

While this is the mantra of many a CS major, I, unfortunately have very little in the way of my will to live (erm, do leetcode problems)
So I devised a strategy where I can force myself to engage in the most important part of any programmer's life.

I taze myself whenever i open a tab that isn't leetcode
